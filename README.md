# My Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my Java learning repository! I began my journey into the world of Java programming on **September 21, 2025**. This file serves as my personal log to track my progress, document the projects I build, and list the key concepts I've learned.

## My Goals

My primary goal is to become proficient in Java. I plan to achieve this by:

- Understanding the core concepts of the language.
- Building small, practical console applications.
- Gradually moving towards more complex projects.
- Learning the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Progress Log

### Day 1: September 21, 2025 - The Adventure Begins!

Today was all about getting my tools ready and diving into the basics.

- **Environment Setup:** Successfully set up my Java development environment using Visual Studio Code, the JDK (Java Development Kit), and the official Java Extension Pack.
- **First Program:** Wrote and ran my first "Hello, World!" application.
- **Core Structure:** Learned about the fundamental structure of a Java program, including the purpose of `public class App` and the crucial `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
- **Compilation:** Understood the difference between source code (`.java` files) and compiled bytecode (`.class` files) and how the Java compiler (`javac`) and JVM work together.
- **First Assignments:** Completed my first two hands-on assignments!

## Projects Completed

Here are the projects I have built so far.

### 1. DIY 4: Age Calculator

- **Description:** A simple console application that asks the user for their birth year and calculates their approximate age.
- **Concepts Learned:**
  - Getting user input from the console using `java.util.Scanner`.
  - Storing whole numbers in `int` variables.
  - Performing basic arithmetic (`-`).
  - Printing formatted output to the console using `System.out.println()` and string concatenation (`+`).

### 2. Project-1: Simple Tip Calculator

- **Description:** A practical tool that calculates a 15% tip based on a user-provided bill amount. The bonus version allows the user to input a custom tip percentage.
- **Concepts Learned:**
  - Using the `Scanner` class for user input.
  - Storing decimal numbers (like money) in `double` variables.
  - Performing multiplication (`*`) and (`-`)to calculate percentages.
  - Combining multiple variables to produce a final result (Total Bill).

## Key Concepts I've Learned So Far

- Basic Java Syntax (`public static void main...`)
- Variables and Data Types (`int`, `double`)
- Getting User Input (`java.util.Scanner`)
- Performing Calculations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Printing to the Console (`System.out.println()`)
- The Java Compilation Process (`.java` -> `.class`)

## What's Next?

My immediate goal is to deepen my understanding of programming logic. I plan to focus on:

- [ ] Learn about `if` / `else` statements to make decisions in my code.
- [ ] Explore different types of loops (`for`, `while`) to repeat actions.
- [ ] Build a more complex project that uses both conditional logic and loops.
